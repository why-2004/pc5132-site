title: "Rear Wing Trim and DRS"

## Trim

When Formula One teams enter different races each season, they adapt their cars to best suit the track conditions. One such way they maximise the car performance is by manipulating the rear wing shape. This is because each track has different downforce requirements, and so the optimal downforce-drag balance is different for each track.

Here is a rear wing for a high-downforce circuit, Monte Carlo (Monaco Grand Prix), and a low-downforce circuit, Monza (Italian Grand Prix):

## Justification

The reason for changing the spec of the rear wing is so that, when the downforce requirement is small, the drag caused by a large rear wing area will outweigh the extra unnecessary downforce. As such, by reducing the wing area, the amount of drag also decreases.

## Drag Reduction System

This system (known as DRS) is a system that assists overtaking drivers in getting past the car in front.

## Design

There is an actuator on the rear wing that opens when the driver pushes the DRS button on their steering wheel. This opens a section of the rear wing (top) which drastically reduces drag by decreasing the effective wing area of the car, by allowing air to exit the rear wing through the open slot (below):

This explains why there is NO DRS in wet races, where the loss in downforce would cause cars to lose control and crash, endangering safety.
