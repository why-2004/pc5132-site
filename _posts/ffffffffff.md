## Intro
A big reason why Formula 1 cars are so much faster than other series despite their theoretically lower top speed is their ability to turn at much higher speeds than other cars.
A simple equation for the maximum speed a car can take through a corner is given by 
 
v = \sqrt (\mu r F / m)
 
where v is the speed of the car, \mu is the coefficient of friction of the tyres, m is the mass of the car and F is the downforce acting on the car. 
In short, the higher the downforce, the faster the car can go through the corner, and thus teams in Formula 1 compete to design a package with high downforce without increasing drag too much.

## Front wing

The front wing is the first part of the car that comes into contact with the air, and is thus responsible for directing the airflow around the car. This means that the aerodynamics of the rest of the car depends on how the front wing is designed to manipulate the incoming airflow.

The front wing of a Formula 1 car is responsible for 3 major roles:
1. Directing airflow away from the front tyres
2. Directing airflow above the body
3. Generating vortices 
 
## Directing air away from tyres
The large and rapidly spinning tyres usually have uneven surfaces, which means that airflow hitting the tyres become turbulent and unpredictable, which makes it difficult to manipulate the air to generate the maximum possible downforce.
 
## Directing airflow above the body
A large part of a Formula 1 car’s downforce comes from the pressure difference between the top and bottom of the car, and directing airflow from the bottom of the car reduces the pressure underneath the car to create higher downforce.
 
## Generating vortices
The shape of the front wing allows it to generate one vortex on either side of the front wing, known as the Y250 vortex. These Y250 vortices then interact with the bargeboards and generate more vortices, some of which move below the body of the car. The vortices below the body of the car direct more air away from the bottom of the car, further decreasing the pressure below the car and increasing the downforce.

## Rear wing

//there was a picture here too
 
The main role of a rear wing in Formula 1 is to balance the downforce produced by the front of the car, so the front tyres are not overloaded with the stresses of accelerating, breaking and turning while the rear tyres slide all over the place during the lap. 
 
Unlike the front wing however, the rear wing works on much simpler principles like Newton’s Third law and the Bernoulli principle.

Airflow around the rear wing (https://www.presticebdt.com/the-aerodynamics-of-f1-rear-wing-cfd-explained/)
 
The first role of the rear wing is to direct the airflow upwards as it flows across the curved surface of the rear wing. By Newton’s Third Law, every action must have an equal and opposite reaction, so by pushing the air upwards, the air exerts a reactionary force to push the rear wing towards the ground.
 
The gaps between plates of the rear wings are also designed to be narrower closer to the tip, accelerating the air flow. Bernoulli’s principle states that when a fluid is flowing faster, it exerts less pressure on its surroundings, so the higher-pressure air above the rear wing pushes down on it, increasing downforce.
 
## Body and Diffuser 

The body of the car is designed to be as close to the ground as possible to increase the velocity of the air flowing below it. Bernoulli’s principle states that a faster moving fluid should be at lower pressure than when it moves at lower speeds, so the lower pressure below the car allows the air above it to push it harder into the ground. 
 
Diffuser directing air flow upwards (http://www.formula1-dictionary.net/diffuser.html)
 
The role of the diffuser is to slow the air below the car down and direct the air upwards to be ‘attached’ to the surrounding air.
 
## Increasing pressure

By expanding the cross-sectional area of the air flow, the speed of the airflow is slowed down, increasing the pressure the air exerts on the surroundings by Bernoulli’s principle. The pressure within a fluid must be continuous, so the air close to the diffuser must be near atmospheric pressure, like the air behind the car. Thus, by increasing the pressure of the air near the end of the car, it means that the air below the body and between the front wing and the diffuser must be at lower pressure, increasing the downforce experienced by the car. 
 
## Directing air upwards

The rear wing directs air from above the car upwards and away from the ground, resulting in a region of lower pressure behind the car. Without the diffuser, there will be 2 separate air streams above and below the car. The separated air streams cause a variety of problems in increased drag and reduced downforce, so teams add a diffuser to the end of the car to help ‘attach’ the two streams together and help mitigate these downsides.
 
## Blown diffuser

In a blown diffuser, the exhaust is blown upwards near the diffuser, helping to reattach the air flow and increasing the speed of the airflow below the car, helping ‘blow’ the diffuser to make it more efficient.
 
## Double diffuser

As discussed earlier, there are many advantages to using a diffuser, and having a larger diffuser magnifies the advantages and minimizes the downsides of creating downforce. However, the FIA has imposed a limit on the size of the diffusers at the end of 2008 in an effort to improve overtaking, meaning most teams only had 175mm of space to work with for their diffusers. The double diffuser was an idea to not completely block off the roof of the car, allowing more room for the air to flow and increasing the cross-sectional area of the air flow while technically not adding material outside the regulation limits.
