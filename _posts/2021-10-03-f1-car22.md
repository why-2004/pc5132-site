The 2022 Formula One regulations bring about a brand new concept of car, one that relies on a completely new concept of producing downforce, called the Venturi Effect (can be found [here]())

## Design Goals

A key goal of this design is to **reduce the generation of dirty air**, which make it difficult for following cars to remain close behind. Analyses show that the downforce production of the tailing car can go as low as 50% in the corners! Cooling also becomes a bigger issue, where extended periods of close following can cause component overheating.

## Changes

Current rear wings and aerodynamic 'furniture' in today's F1 cars produce a large amount of turbulent air, which cannot be effectively used to generate downforce used in a meaningful way in general. 

Using the Venturi Tunnel at the sides of the car to produce downforce would mitigate the generation of this dirty air, while still producing large amounts of downforce.

Furthermore, the rear wing for the new car is **redesigned** to ensure that the dirty air is directed to the diffuser, which is also updated to be facing upwards to expel the dirty air high, far above the following cars.

The wheel covers and wheel inlets also mitigate the airflow above the wheel, which while improves the downforce production, contributes quite significantly to the aerodynamic wake of the car.
