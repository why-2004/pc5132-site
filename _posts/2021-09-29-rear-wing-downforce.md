The main role of a rear wing in Formula 1 is to balance the downforce produced by the front of the car, so the front tyres are not overloaded with the stresses of accelerating, breaking and turning while the rear tyres slide all over the place during the lap. Unlike the front wing however, the rear wing works on much simpler principles like Newton’s Third law and the Bernoulli principle. ![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3a3V8p9-LT6YK0U7zuw79wxMVdkxDa_afR3UlU9xIGZVdhLnzxQCU5SGomtVNa6cNt-y-DnC2JxQF9zShT9XdEpQtZj2_561JL8jMepRCn4Hb8g7YPWJ0VlqckLyrispyeTaKNso=s0)

Airflow around the rear wing (https://www.presticebdt.com/the-aerodynamics-of-f1-rear-wing-cfd-explained/) 

The first role of the rear wing is to direct the airflow upwards as it flows across the curved surface of the rear wing. By Newton’s Third Law, every action must have an equal and opposite reaction, so by pushing the air upwards, the air exerts a reactionary force to push the rear wing towards the ground.

The gaps between plates of the rear wings are also designed to be narrower closer to the tip, accelerating the air flow. Bernoulli’s principle states that when a fluid is flowing faster, it exerts less pressure on its surroundings, so the higher-pressure air above the rear wing pushes down on it, increasing downforce.
