2. The double-diffuser design was controversial; teams like Red Bull and Ferrari lodged protests questioning its legality in the FIA Court of Appeal. The design was deemed legal.
3. Due to a lack of funding the BGP-001 didn't match the pace of development of other teams like Red Bull; by the end of the season it actually fell behind in terms of pace.
