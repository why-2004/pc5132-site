<h2> Questions </h2>

<h3> 1. In what way(s) is a Formula One best at?</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Highest top speed
  <li> Fastest acceleration
  <li> Highest cornering speed
  <li> Efficiency
</ol>

<br>

<h3> 2. What is DRS used for</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Increase downforce for better handling
  <li> Decrease drag for straights
  <li> Redirect air to turn better
  <li> Let air completely bypass the rear wing
</ol>

<br>

<h3> 3. How does a diffuser help in F1?</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Encourages air to flow past the car, decreasing drag
  <li> Redirects air away from the rear wing, decreasing drag
  <li> Increase air flow to engine, increasing engine power
  <li> Decrease speed of air below the car, increasing downforce
</ol>

<br>

<h3> 4. What does a front wing do</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Directing air away from tyres
  <li> Directing airflow above the body
  <li> Generating vortices
  <li> Forcing air to the engine
</ol>

<br>

<h3> 5. What does a rear wing do</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Produce downforce, by redirecting air upwards
  <li> Produce downforce, through Bernoulli's principle
  <li> Decrease drag, by directing airflow away from the car
  <li> Redirect engine exhaust air away from the surrounding air
</ol>

<br>

<h3> 6. What kind of diffuser is banned?</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Body Diffuser
  <li> Blown Diffuser
  <li> Double diffuser
  <li> Big Diffuser
</ol>

<br>

<h3> 7. What is the use of the F duct</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Improve cornering by increasing downforce
  <li> Increase speed by diverting air to the engine
  <li> Cool the driver
  <li> Make the rear wing stall, reducing downforce
</ol>
