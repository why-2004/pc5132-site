    A big reason why Formula 1 cars are so much faster than other series despite their theoretically lower top speed is their ability to turn at much higher speeds than other cars. A simple equation for the maximum speed a car can take through a corner is given by 
$$
v = \sqrt {\frac{\mu r F } m}
$$
where $v$ is the speed of the car, $\mu$ is the coefficient of friction of the tyres, $m$ is the mass of the car and $F$ is the downforce acting on the car. 
In short, the higher the downforce, the faster the car can go through the corner, and thus teams in Formula 1 compete to design a package with high downforce without increasing drag too much.
